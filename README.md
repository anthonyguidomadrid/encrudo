## Getting started

To get started, read the following guidelines.

- [Environment variables](./README.md#environment-variables)
- [Dependencies](./README.md#dependencies)
- [Development](./README.md#development)
- [Contentful API & GraphQL](./README.md#contentful-api--graphql)
- [Deployment](./README.md#deployment)

### Environment Variables Reference

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add the necessary values. Here are the main variables used:

- `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID`: [Find your space ID](https://www.contentful.com/help/find-space-id/)
- `CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_API_TOKEN`: [Contentful Delivery API token](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/)
- `CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_API_TOKEN`: [Contentful Preview API token](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-preview-api/)
- `CONTENTFUL_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT`: Contentful GraphQL endpoint
- `EMAIL_AUTH_USER`: Gmail email for sending contact form messages
- `EMAIL_AUTH_PASS`: Gmail password
- `EMAIL_RECIPIENT`: Recipient for contact form messages
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: The public URL of your site (used for SEO, sitemaps, etc.)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_CLIENT_KEY`: [Google reCAPTCHA client key](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/intro)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTAG_ID`: Google Analytics/Tag Manager keys

Other variables may be required for deployment or analytics. See `.env.example` for the full list.

### SEO & Sitemap

This project uses [`next-seo`](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo) for SEO meta tags and structured data, and [`next-sitemap`](https://github.com/iamvishnusankar/next-sitemap) for sitemap generation.

- Sitemaps are generated automatically after build (`yarn build && yarn postbuild`).
- **Important:** Remove any static `public/sitemap.xml` if you want to use the dynamic sitemap generated by `next-sitemap`.
- Configure your domain and sitemap options in `next-sitemap.js` (if present).

### Static Assets

All static images, SVGs, and favicons are located in the `public/assets` and `public/favicons` folders. To update or add new assets, place them in the appropriate folder and reference them in your code as needed.

### Dependencies

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
yarn
```

### Run the Starter Template in development mode

```bash
yarn dev
```

The Starter Template should be up and running on `http://localhost:3000`.

All necessary dependencies are installed under `node_modules` and any necessary tools can be accessed via npm scripts.

## Development

### Node

It is recommended to use the Node version listed in the `.nvmrc` file, we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to easily switch between Node versions.

### Husky & git hooks

This repository makes use of [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to enforce commit hooks.

The config for both the `pre-commit` and `pre-push` hooks can be found in the `.husky` folder, located in the root of the project.

---

#### Pre-commit

Before allowing a commit, we require a successful result from the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) and our `lint` script will be run.

This ensures all ESLint and Prettier rules are enforced on the files that are staged to be committed.

The `tsc` command is run separately from the `lint` step because we require the Typescript compiler to sample _all_ files.

This is important to ensure that no deviating types were introduced by the [codegen](./README.md#graphql--code-generation) for example.

---

#### Pre-push

The same two tasks are run for pre-push and for pre-commit.

---

#### Overriding the Husky git hooks

In case of wanting to bypass the `pre-commit` or `pre-push` hooks, pass a `--noVerify` flag to your Git commands.

⚠️ Make sure you only use this if you know why you're using it. ⚠️

### Contentful API & GraphQL

This project makes use of Contentful's [GraphQL API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/graphql/).

API calls made to the Contentful GraphQL endpoint are made through `graphql-request`.

The types are generated from the `.graphql` files located in the `/lib/graphql/` directory:

1. `lib/graphql/[fileName].graphql` is detected by the [codegen](./README.md#graphql--code-generation)
2. `lib/__generated/sdk.ts` is generated
3. Within the generated file, they types and a new `getSdk` function are generated
4. The `getSdk` function can now be imported and used within the `getStaticProps` in the pages files

### GraphQL & code generation

We use `graphql-codegen` to generate a type-safe API client, utilizing [GraphQLClient](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/typescript/typescript-graphql-request) as the "client".

The data for the hooks is pre-fetched on the server-side.

---

#### Commands

In order to (re-)generate the GraphQL schema, types and hooks, please use either of the following commands:

- `yarn graphql-codegen:generate` generates a schema, types and code to fetch data from the Contentful APIs
- `yarn graphql-codegen:watch` similar to the `generate` command, but it runs as a watch task which will rerun the steps when changes are made in the `.graphql` files

The first steps of the codegen generate files that contain the GraphQL schema and matching TypeScript types.
They're generated to the `src/lib/__generated` folder and ought to be committed once altered/added to the repository.

Additionally, the codegen watches `.graphql` files in our `src` folder, if it runs successfully it generates a `__generated` folder collocated in the folder where the `.graphql` file was found.

One exception to this rule is the `src/lib/fragments` folder which contains shared GraphQL Fragments that are used in several other queries/fragments.

The TS types for these files are generated in the same location, in a `__generated` folder and like the other files ought to be committed.

---

#### Configuration

The configuration for the codegen can be found in `codegen.ts`, located in the root of the project.

## Deployment

Currently deployed on: [encrudotaller.com](https://www.encrudotaller.com/)

- The project is configured for deployment on Vercel, but a `netlify.toml` is also present for Netlify support. Adjust the build command/environment as needed for your platform.
- The build command ensures `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is set correctly for SEO and sitemaps.

### Dynamic Imports & Performance

Some components (such as Header, Footer, and others) are loaded using [Next.js dynamic imports](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import) to improve performance and reduce initial bundle size. See the relevant files in `src/components/templates/layout/` and other component folders.

### Linting & Formatting

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting. Run `yarn lint` to check for lint errors, and configure your editor to use Prettier for consistent formatting.

### Troubleshooting & FAQ

- **404 on dynamic pages (e.g., `/aviso-legal`)**: Make sure the corresponding entry exists and is published in Contentful for the correct locale.
- **reCAPTCHA not working on multiple domains**: Add all domains to the allowed list in the Google reCAPTCHA admin console.
- **Sitemap not updating**: Remove any static `public/sitemap.xml` and ensure `next-sitemap` runs after build.
- **Static assets not updating**: Clear your browser cache or CDN cache after updating files in `public/assets` or `public/favicons`.
